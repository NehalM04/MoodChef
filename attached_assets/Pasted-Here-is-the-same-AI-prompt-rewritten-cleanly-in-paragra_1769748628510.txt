Here is the same AI prompt rewritten cleanly in paragraph form, exactly how you can paste it into any AI agent and get the basic layout generated properly:

You are a senior frontend engineer tasked with building a hackathon-ready UI skeleton for a web project called MoodChef, which is a mood-based recipe discovery application. Your goal is to generate a clean, professional, and well-structured basic layout only using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. Do not use any frameworks, libraries, or advanced animations, and avoid complex logic at this stage. Focus strictly on layout, structure, responsiveness, and visual polish while keeping the code beginner-friendly, readable, and well-commented. The UI should follow a modern dark theme with soft shadows, rounded elements, and clean spacing so that it already feels like a real product even without functionality.

The deliverable should consist of three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js, where JavaScript contains only placeholder comments for future interactivity. The layout should include a main app wrapper containing a fixed top navigation bar with the app name “MoodChef” on the left and navigation links like Explore, Random Dish, and About on the right. Below this, create a hero section with a large headline saying “Tell me your mood. I’ll tell you what to cook.” along with a short descriptive subtext and a responsive set of mood buttons such as Lazy, Healthy, Romantic, Student, and Party. After the hero section, add a horizontal filter bar with buttons like Under 20 min, Veg, Spicy, and Budget. The main content area should be a responsive recipe grid using CSS Grid, displaying at least six sample recipe cards, each containing an image placeholder, recipe name, cooking time and difficulty text, and a “View Recipe” button. Finally, include a simple footer with centered text reading “Built with ❤️ at Hackathon — MoodChef.”

Styling should use semantic HTML, CSS variables for theme colors, and clearly separated CSS sections with comments. The design must be fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop. Output the code clearly separated under headings for each file, ensuring the final result looks professional, structured, and hackathon-ready even without JavaScript logic.
